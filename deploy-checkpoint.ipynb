It is caused by delay in signal, inappropriate timing of traffic signalling etc. The delay of traffic light is hard coded and it does not depend on traffic. Therefore, for optimising traffic control, there is an increasing demand in systematic quick automatic system. This project is designed to develop a density based dynamic traffic signal control. The signal timing changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction. The microcontroller used in this project is ARDUINO. The system contains IR sensors & ultrasonic sensors (transmitter and receiver) which will be mounted on the either side of the road on poles. It gets activated and receives the signal as the vehicles passes close by it.\\n\\n\\n\\nEXPERIENCE:                                        \\n\\n  \\n\\nI am carrying an experience of  2 years  from MetroLabs Services Pvt Ltd.\\n\\n\\n\\n   ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES :\\n\\n\\n\\nOver 2 years of extensive experience as a Front End Developer with solid understanding of website and application designing, development of different modules using ReactJS.\\n\\nProfessional understanding of Software development life cycle (SDLC) as well as various phases such as Analysis Design, Development and Testing.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExperienced in developing User Interface using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript,  DOM, ReactJS.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExperience in DOM as I used it in interacting with objects in HTML documents.  \\n\\n\\n\\nExperience in working with Express creating Restful API, URL routing, creating and handling HTTP CRUD \\n\\n\\n\\nGood experience in using React JS components, Forms, Events, Keys, Router, Redux Store, action creator and reducer etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nGood experience in developing draggable grid layout using react-grid-layout package.\\n\\n\\n\\nGood knowledge on building tables/grid using react-table and ag-grid library and office-fabric-ui.  \\n\\n\\n\\nExperience in maintaining APIs and existing applications.\\n\\n\\n\\nWrite code that is cross-platform and cross-device compatible.\\n\\n\\n\\nConverted PSD files into pure hand-written HTML and CSS pages \\n\\nEffectively represent the voice of the user to influence and improve design decisions\\n\\nConsult with the cross-functional team throughout development, testing, and rollout to ensure designs are understood, implemented, and communicated appropriately\\n\\nWebsite hosting is one of the major role in my working period and according with client modifications, deletions etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nGood communication skills, both verbal and written.\\n\\n\\n\\nTECHNICAL EXPERTISE:\\n\\n\\n\\nWeb Technologies \\xa0\\xa0\\t:  Html5, Css3, JavaScript, Responsive Designs,\\n\\n  Bootstrap, ReactJS, JSON\\n\\n  \\n\\nDevelopment Tools \\t: \\xa0 Visual Studio Code\\n\\nOperating Systems \\xa0\\xa0\\t: \\xa0Windows 10\\n\\n\\n\\nPERSONAL DETAILS:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tDate of Birth\\t:\\t15, August,1997.\\n\\n\\tFather’s Name\\t:\\tMr. K.Sudhakar Reddy,\\n\\n\\tPermanent Address\\t:\\tH.no:5-8-171/3, Bmr Nagar, Naidupet.\\n\\n\\tLanguages known\\t:\\tTelugu, Hindi & English.\\n\\n\\tHobbies\\t:\\tPlaying cricket, Watching news.\\n\\n\\n\\nSTRENGTHS:\\n\\n\\n\\nPunctuality\\n\\nPositive attitude\\n\\nLeadership\\n\\nTeamwork\\n\\n\\n\\nLANGUAGES KNOWN:\\n\\n\\n\\nTelugu\\n\\nHindi\\n\\nEnglish\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDECLARATION:\\n\\n\\n\\nI hereby declare that all the above mention details are true to best my knowledge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlace:\\n\\nDate:\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tK.Deepak Reddy',\n",
